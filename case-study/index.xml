      <description>Pearson has trusted KrakenD as its API Gateway solution for the Parent App, which provides parents with a wide range of resources, including podcasts, infographics, quizzes, and checklists, to support their children&amp;rsquo;s progress in learning.
KrakenD API Gateway offers the endpoints to the Parent App and sits between end-users and the Pearson services, which provide all the data that KrakenD aggregates to supply the use case.
KrakenD handles OAuth with HMAC security and implements minor custom middlewares to fit the desired end-user consumption of the services.</description>

      <description>Letgo is the biggest and fastest-growing app for buying and selling locally.
Letgo is both a desktop application (SPA) and a mobile application with native implementations for every OS. As Letgo&amp;rsquo;s organization is large, the UI experience of each client is handled by a different team.
Letgo uses different clusters of KrakenD API Gateway per client, allowing each team to have its customized views of merged data. The API contract used in every device is preserved and respected even when the backends need to change their specification.</description>

      <description>iContainers is an ocean freight forwarder that allows you to compare, book, manage, and track maritime shipments in real-time without intermediaries.
As importers and exporters combine more than 500,000 rates and maritime transport routes from different providers, KrakenD plays the role of a Backend for Frontend in several SPAs. Some examples are the back-office, the partners portal, or the pricing API.
KrakenD&amp;rsquo;s primary duty in all these cases is to provide a reliable way to fetch data from multiple providers and APIs and merge the results of all the services into useful endpoints.</description>
